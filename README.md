Scraps of Fast Fashion

Landfilled Textiles data source: https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/textiles-material-specific-data

This project is intended to be an installation within an art gallery, potentially with a focus on fashion or the climate crisis. A fancy frame, expected for an art gallery setting, has a chaotic collage of fabric scraps seeming to burst out of the bounds of the frame. Using data of landfilled textile waste over the past few decades, an Arduino controlls seven Servo motors to create moving and shifting scraps of fabric at rates scaling with the amount of textiles landfilled. Every 8 seconds, the data set advances, and the Servos speed up their movement, generating a harsh, anxiety-inducing image. An LCD screen mounted below the frame shows the year, and the amount of landfilled textile waste in tons. Once the data reaches the year 2018, the LCD and Servos restart back at year 1960, and you can see the dramatic difference between the amount of waste produced in the much calmer fabric scraps in the frame. By being installed in an art gallery, the hope is that this ambient data display will reach people on a more abstract emotional level, demonstrating the urgency and importance of addressing the issues and concerns with fast fashion and its implications on the deteriorating environment.
